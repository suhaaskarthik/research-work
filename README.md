I have coded out two research-based approaches to find the optimal number of clusters for a given dataset to be used in a clustering algorithm
information criteria-based approach uses a more complex algorithm by taking power with the Euclidean distances, silhouette score find the best inter to intra cluster ratio
All codes have been commented out for information
Check out my ppt for further references!!!!
